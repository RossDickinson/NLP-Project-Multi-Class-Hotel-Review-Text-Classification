# Multi-Class-Hotel-Review-Text-Classification
This project pertains to evaluate the data collection, wrangling, preprocessing, configuration and performance of a multi-class text classification project. I created a bidirectional LSTM RNN model, tuned the respective hyperparameters, and evaluated the performance metrics of the chosen model on the test data.
